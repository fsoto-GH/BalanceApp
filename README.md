# Balance App
This is a Personal Balance Tracking App which provides a way to help organize or consolidate your personal expenses. 
I created it since I always found myself needing to use a calculator to figure out my finances across different credit cards and banks.

The main purpose of it is to track balances (money you have) against payments (money you owe). However, it does have the ability to accumulate cashback for reference.
From the app, you are able to add, edit, and remove activities. You can also export (and import!) or save the summary for later use.


# How to Use
To run it, you can publish this app wherever you wish so that you can find it easily OR compile and run the executable.
